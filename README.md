# learning-haskell

This repository will hold my haskell progress. I'll share some thoughts I have and code I've written along the way.

# resources

look at resources.md to checkout what I've read of watched and some comments on what I understood from it.

# how do I start

I don't know about you but I need a practical example and a project to work on and improve so I can improve with it. Doing simple examples and functions or list implementations is great but I've already done it and while it does help you get use to the syntax and gets you comfortable with writing code it doen't give you error messages and it doen't make you really think about real problems.
Because of those reasons I'll probably do a simple server with requests and responces, because it can grow into anything I like down the road. A todo list or a mindmap or a distributed system or whatever your brain can come up with.

# goals set to begin with:

* GHC/Type families
* GADTs (Generalised algebraic datatypes)
* Existential types
